For Libraries

    I compile twitter4j jar file to work with twitter apis
    I compile converter json to can work with json type 
    I compile circleimageview to set image in circle shape with some features
    I compile Piccaso to load profile image 
    I compile recycler and card view for layout design 
    i compile rosetta for changing app language 

For Patterns & Code

    I use MVP pattern for make code clear and easy
    I use singleton design pattern in sharedData class to work with SharedPreferences
    I use sharedpreference to save data of users and followers in it after convert to json string 
    I use AsyncTask thread to handle network os exception while using twitter4j to make api call
    I use class extend application for making language library working well
    I use boolean variable active to handle if view still on screen or user move from activity
    
For Desgin

    I use simple design as possible to make it easy for user to move between data and use recycler view and card view to make
    UI much better , handle some UX also when no tweets found , no data found and server error .. use snack bar and toast to 
    show messages to user 

I use comments before methods to explain what it do 
Most of my decisions i take it to serve app flow except if you have multiple accounts when you logout from one account it run the first account on accounts list
